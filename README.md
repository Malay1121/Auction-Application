# auction

This is an website which I and my friend made for a cricket tournament in our school. We used this application to decide the teams.

## How does it work

- There is an admin panel where you get the option to add players or the people you want to bid on.
- When you add all the players, you will get an option to save them and when you click on it, all the players will be sent to Python and will be saved there.
- Now you will get an option to start auction and you will be navigated to waiting screen.
- Now the bidders will join from another screen. As soon as they enter their name, their name will be shown on waiting screen.
- As soon as all the bidders join, the admin will start the auction from the waiting screen.
- When the admin will start the auction, their screen will change and that would be the screen where players and the bids will be shown.
- Now bidders will get 2 buttons to bid, 1 will be to increase price by 1 million and the other to increase the price by 2 million.
- At last, when all the players are bidded, admin's screen will be navigated to team screen where you can see which bidder bidded which player.
